This is an experiment with ClojureScript.  It will never be completed, but will slowly head in the direction of becoming the Tempest arcade game, until I move on to other things.

I do not know Clojure, nor ClojureScript, nor Javascript, so if you use this as a reference, be careful.  And don't judge my programming skills based on this.
